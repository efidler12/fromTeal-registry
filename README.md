List of independent teams organized by the problems they're trying to solve


We’ve all worked for companies that were funded by VC’s, who told them to hire like crazy (even before making 1 sale) & then layoff like crazy, which proves how they treat us like expandable commodities. There’s something terribly wrong with this model: these companies were started by engineers, driven by the passion to create something meaningful & solve real problems. But the founders then give the company keys to VC’s who are just driven by the mission of increasing profits to shareholders. The VC’s add a bunch of engineers, who then ride on the engineers back, telling them what to do, killing their creativity & enjoyment of work, & eventually throwing to the garbage the real purpose the company was founded for. 

All these companies wouldn’t exist without engineers starting them & building the actual products. All the people trying to make profits from that aren’t really necessary. We believe that a team of engineers, driven by the passion to create something new that solves a problem in the world & the freedom to do what they love, can win against any profit-driven bloated organization, with layers of management/HR/VC’s riding on the engineers back.

But it’s not easy to replace an existing model that works - we need to experiment with ways to solve the problems that the old model solved, such as managing equity & enabling engineers to work on something until people pay for it & they can make a living out of it. That’s why we started fromTeal - a non-profit organization, founded by engineers, trying to experiment with ways to replace the existing model. You can read more about our mission [here](http://www.fromteal.com). 

We start with this registry of teams & their purpose - the problem they want to solve - which we hope will help engineers discover teams & join forces. These teams aren’t afraid to state their mission publicly, because even though they want to succeed financially & make a living, they’re not driven just by profits, but rather by their purpose - solving a real problem/need people have. If they’ll be copied by other companies, driven just by profits, at least the problem will be solved. However, we believe customers will prefer the company driven by purpose rather than the one driven just by profits.
